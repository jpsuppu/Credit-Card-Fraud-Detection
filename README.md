# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Project Overview:
=================
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a dataset of anonymized credit card transactions, we aim to build a classification model that can differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The key challenge in this problem is the extremely imbalanced dataset, where fraudulent transactions make up only 0.172% of the total transactions.


Problem Statement:
=================
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to the financial sector, leading to huge losses for businesses and users alike. The ability to detect fraudulent transactions is crucial for credit card companies to protect users from unauthorized transactions. This project seeks to build a classification model using anonymized data that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent based on several features. The dataset includes 492 fraud cases out of 284,807 transactions, highlighting the importance of addressing class imbalance.

Data Sources:
=============
The dataset used for this project can be found in the Guide - Data Science 2.0 Capstone Project provided by upGrad on the PRISM Portal.

Methodology:
============
This project follows a structured data science methodology:
